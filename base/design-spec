  Strong horizontal alignment
  
  Consistent margins and padding

Grid Behavior

  Desktop-first, responsive down
  
  Two-column layouts used for:
  
    Image + content pairing
  
  Icons grouped in evenly spaced horizontal rows

Spacing

  Generous vertical spacing between sections
  
  Tight spacing within grouped elements (icons + labels)
  
  Visual breathing room around CTAs



5. Navigation & Header

Header Style

Transparent or dark background over hero

Minimal navigation items

CTA button visually separated (accent color)

Navigation Behavior

Simple hover states (color change only)

No drop shadows or complex animations

Fixed or sticky behavior optional but appropriate


6. Buttons & CTAs
Primary Button

Solid red background

White text

Rectangular with slightly rounded corners

Strong visual weight

Secondary Button (if used)

White or transparent background

Red or black text

Red border optional

Interaction States

Hover: subtle darkening or brightness shift

Active: slight scale or opacity change

No heavy motion or bounce effects


7. Iconography

Style

Line or minimal filled icons

Single color (red or black depending on background)

Simple, recognizable silhouettes

Usage

Used to represent feature categories

Always paired with short labels

Consistent size and spacing


8. Imagery Treatment (Non-Descriptive)

High contrast photography

Dark backgrounds or dramatic lighting

Subjects isolated clearly from background

Images serve as energy drivers, not decoration

Image Placement

Hero: dominant, edge-to-edge

Supporting sections: framed within grid

No rounded images; sharp edges only


9. Section Styling Patterns
Hero Section

Dark background

Oversized headline

Strong focal point

Minimal distractions

Feature Strip

Light background

Icon + label repeat

Horizontally aligned

Content Section

Light background

Text block with strong left alignment

Vertical accent line or color block for emphasis

Footer

Dark background

Minimal content

Small typography

Social icons aligned horizontally


10. Motion & Effects (Optional)

Minimal transitions

Fade or color-shift on hover

No parallax required

Avoid over-animation—strength comes from stillness



11. Accessibility Notes

High color contrast throughout

Large headline text improves readability

Clear CTA distinction

Icons should not be the sole indicator of meaning



12. Developer Implementation Notes

CSS variables recommended for color tokens

Utility-first CSS (Tailwind-style) maps well to layout

Avoid heavy JS—layout is primarily structural

Image overlays can be achieved via pseudo-elements
